RUNNING THE REED TORRENT CLIENT

To run the Reed Torrent Client on Windows, you need to install the following prerequisites:

1. Install GCC for Windows from https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/
2. Install MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org/
3. Open MSYS2 terminal and run:
   pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config
4. Add MSYS2 bin to your PATH: C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
   - Right-click on "This PC" or "My Computer" and select "Properties"
   - Click on "Advanced system settings"
   - Click on "Environment Variables"
   - Under "System variables", find and select "Path", then click "Edit"
   - Click "New" and add "C:\msys64\mingw64\bin"
   - Click "OK" on all dialogs to save the changes
5. Restart your terminal or command prompt
6. Run the following commands:
   go get -u github.com/go-gl/gl/v3.2-core/gl
   go build
   .\reed.exe

These steps are required to build and run the application on Windows.

TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON BUILD ERRORS:

If you encounter linking errors related to pthread (multiple definition of pthread functions), this is a known issue with CGo on Windows. The project includes a gl_windows.go file that adds a linker flag to allow multiple definitions and resolve this issue. Make sure this file is present in your project directory before building.

RUNNING FROM AN IDE:

If you want to run the application from an IDE like GoLand or VS Code:

1. Complete steps 1-5 above to install the prerequisites
2. Open the project in your IDE
3. Make sure your IDE's terminal can access the MSYS2 bin directory
4. Run the `go get -u github.com/go-gl/gl/v3.2-core/gl` command in your IDE's terminal
5. Use your IDE's run functionality to build and run the application

Note: There is no pre-built binary available for this application. You must build it from source using the steps above.
